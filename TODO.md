Yes, there are some compatibility considerations:
Major Compatibility Issues
1. AlarmManager Exact Alarms (Android 12+)
   Your setReminder function uses setExactAndAllowWhileIdle(), which requires special permission on Android 12+ (API 31+):
   xml<!-- Add to AndroidManifest.xml -->
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM" />
   And you need to request this permission at runtime on Android 12+. Without it, reminders won't fire.
2. PendingIntent Flags (Android 12+)
   You're correctly using FLAG_IMMUTABLE, which is required on Android 12+. Good.
3. WebView JavaScript Interface (Android 4.2+)
   The @JavascriptInterface annotation is required for API 17+. You're using it correctly, so this should work on all modern Android versions.
   Minor Considerations
4. Notification Channels (Android 8.0+)
   Your ReminderReceiver will need to create a notification channel on Android 8.0+ or notifications won't show. Check if you have this in your ReminderReceiver.kt.
5. Background Restrictions (Android 9+)
   Doze mode and App Standby can delay alarms. Your use of setExactAndAllowWhileIdle() handles this correctly.
   Minimum SDK Recommendation
   Based on your code, you should set:
   gradleminSdk = 23  // Android 6.0 (covers 98%+ of devices)
   targetSdk = 34  // Latest
   What You Should Add
   In your Activity/Fragment where you use the Weblet, check for exact alarm permission on Android 12+:
   kotlinif (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.S) {
   val alarmManager = getSystemService(Context.ALARM_SERVICE) as AlarmManager
   if (!alarmManager.canScheduleExactAlarms()) {
   // Request permission or inform user reminders won't work
   val intent = Intent(Settings.ACTION_REQUEST_SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM)
   startActivity(intent)
   }
   }
   The rest of your WebView code should work fine across all modern Android versions.
